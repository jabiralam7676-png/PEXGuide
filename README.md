### What is PixelExtended?

**PixelExtended** (PEX in short), is a fork of the wonderful ROM, **PixelExperience** (PE in short), that has been discontinued by the developers of PE. Since PE is open source, PEX developers took the chance to fork **PixelExperience** and make it their own ROM, **PixelExtended**. **PixelExperience** has a version named PixelExperience Plus, which is a extended version of PixelExperience, which got discontinued, the developers of PEX did NOT fork PixelExperience Plus.

### What about PixelOS?

Some people may know about PixelOS, another open source ROM like PixelExtended and PixelExperience. Which is a alternative to both PE and PEX. In terms of popularity, PEX is less popular. I will make another guide about PixelOS.
